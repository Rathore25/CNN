# Convolutional Neural Networks

- Visualized activations of different feature maps to show functioning of hidden neural layers
- Analyzed feature invariance due to vertical translation, scale, and rotation of images
- Analyzed the effects of change in hyper-parameters namely filter sizes and strides
